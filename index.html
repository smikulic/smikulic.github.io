  	<h3>Hello!</h3>
  	<p>My name is Sinisa Mikulic, and I know answers to these questions!</p>

  	<h4>General Questions:</h4>
  	<table>
  		<tr>
  			<td><p>What did you learn yesterday/this week?</p></td>
  			<td><p>ES6 classes. I’ve been learning about how having a single convenient declarative form makes class patterns easier to use. They also support constructors prototype-based inheritance, super calls, instance methods and static methods.</p></td>
  		</tr>
		<tr>
		  	<td><p>What excites or interests you about coding?</p></td>
		  	<td><p>I truly enjoy solving problems. More precisely, developing a smart solution for a problem that would otherwise take much longer to do manually. The solution could then be applied in the future to many similar problems.</p></td>
	  	</tr>
	  	<tr>
		  	<td><p>What UI, Security, Performance, SEO, Maintainability or Technology considerations do you make while building a web application or site?</p></td>
		  	<td>
		  		<p>In all of my work, user/client experience is always the top priority.  However, it also depends on the project requirements.</p>
		  		<p>If the project were 'fire and forget', then I would focus on the standards and longevity of that project.  If it were clear that there would be no maintenance on it, it would need to be future-proof (cross browser and device UI solutions).</p>
		  		<p>On the other hand, high-scale and agile projects would need much more effort into making the code modular, reusable, well documented, test covered and and in general more maintainable.</p>
		  	</td>
	  	</tr>
	  	<tr>
		  	<td><p>Talk about your preferred development environment.</p></td>
		  	<td>
		  		<p>Gulp task runner won my heart with its convention over configuration. It goes hand in hand with npm packages and is super easy to setup. Terminal is a must, even in the case where there is a time-saving GUI solution, there are still so many problems that can be resolved just by using a command line.</p>
		  		<p>Editors can be as simple as Sublime Text or as powerful as IDEs like WebStorm, Jira or other project management tools which keep your day to day progress in order.</p>
		  	</td>
	  	</tr>
	  	<tr>
		  	<td><p>Which version control systems are you familiar with?</p></td>
		  	<td>
		  		<p>Git, and SVN. I have worked with both but Git and its workflows (e.g. Gitflow) for agile development keep your mind off of versioning and let you focus on development.</p>
		  	</td>
	  	</tr>
	  	<tr>
		  	<td><p>Can you describe your workflow when you create a web page?</p></td>
		  	<td>
		  		
		  	</td>
	  	</tr>
	  	<tr>
		  	<td><p>If you have 5 different stylesheets, how would you best integrate them into the site?</p></td>
		  	<td>
		  		<p>From a performance perspective, a monolithic stylesheet is best because the request number is a bigger performance concern than the size of one. Thus, I would concatenate them into one bigger stylesheet file and then minimize it by using build tools so I can keep my development files separate and happy in their structure.</p>
		  	</td>
	  	</tr>
	  	<tr>
		  	<td><p>Can you describe the difference between progressive enhancement and graceful degradation?</p></td>
		  	<td>
		  		<p>Sure! Progressive enhancement is mostly encouraged by a mobile first approach for developing responsive websites.  It would like you to display all of the important informational sections on the smallest desired screen and then proportionally scale it up so it fits bigger screens by changing its shape to fit them.</p>
		  		<p>Graceful degradation keeps your focus on desktop screens and encourages you to remove information/features which wouldn't make sense to keep on smaller screens.</p>
		  		<p>For example, graceful degradation would like you to remove a huge slider, which uses some HD images and heavy weight scripts to run on mobile phones. However, they wouldn't be able to run those scripts or would have no marketing impact when presenting those images. So, it would be replaced by simple text. Using progressive enhancement method you could either start building slider with a much more standardized scripts or go with the decision that the slider won't even be necessary on desktop screen but the text should just appear larger.</p>

	  	<tr>
		  	<td><p>What is Flash of Unstyled Content? How do you avoid FOUC?</p></td>
		  	<td>
		  		<p>When browsers encounter a stylesheet loading directive, they can either stall parsing and wait for the stylesheet to load, keep going, or stall on demand. Safari currently uses the ‘keep going’ approach. This triggers an FOUC when a script tries to access a property that the browser doesn't know the value of because the CSS hasn't loaded yet. The effect is having a website look like it's unstyled for a few seconds.</p>
		  		<p>A simple method for minimizing FOUC is by hiding all or part of the web page until all styles and JavaScript are finished by applying a class name "js" as the selector that hides all content within a container that has an id="fouc".</p>

  	<table>
  		<tr>
  			<td><p>What does a doctype do?</p></td>
  			<td><p>Doctype describes the HTML that will be used in our page and it’s placed at the top of the HTML markup. Browsers also use the doctype to determine how to render a page and whether to use quirks mode or not.</p></td>
  		</tr>

		  	<td><p>Yes, I have used it usually plucked out from frameworks like Bootstrap or Griddle. Sometimes, I've used a grid system like Flexbox and even custom grids.</p><p>I prefer Bootstrap grid because it supports a variety of browsers and devices due to its responsiveness and it is easily overridden with custom code if needed. In a relatively simple project, I would use custom grids since it would provide less code and more custom solution to suit its purposes.</p></td>

		  	<td><p>The advantages are clearly code maintainability and code reduction because ofthe ability to write variables and mixins.  Furthermore, it provides easier CSS file structure and within the CSS selectors it provides clear encapsulation with its nesting capabilities.</p><p>As a downside, this could also lead to huge CSS files being generated. Which will happen if developers are not paying enough attention to how they utilize preprocessor language, such as nesting the selector too deep. It also adds complexity to the project because of the package that will handle preprocessing.</p></td>

  	<h4>JS Questions:</h4>
  	<table>
  		<tr>
  			<td><p>Explain event delegation</p></td>
  			<td>
  				<p>Event delegation allows you to avoid adding event listeners to specific nodes. Instead, the event listener is added to one parent. That event listener analyzes bubbled events to find a match on child elements.</p>
  				<p>Simple example would be when event object bubbles up to a parent DIV which contains child elements that were clicked. This object would contain target reference to a clicked child node which is how we would identify which node was clicked.</p>
  			</td>
  		</tr>
  		<tr>
  			<td><p>Explain how this works in JavaScript</p></td>
  			<td><p>this is as a keyword that evaluates to the value of the ThisBinding of the current execution context, which means it is contained in Javascript interpreter while the code is being executed. It could be executed in global context, inside object method, context-less functions, constructors, functions defined on prototype chain, call, apply, bind functions and inside event handlers.</p></td>
  		</tr>
  		<tr>
  			<td><p>Explain how prototypal inheritance works</p></td>
  			<td><p></p></td>
  		</tr>
  		<tr>
  			<td><p>What do you think of AMD vs CommonJS?</p></td>
  			<td>
  				<p>CommonJS approach is a bit simpler with loading files from the local disk and non-intrusive syntax, while AMD is more flexible but also needs to download files through the network, regardless of asynchronous approch and adds mental overhead with more boilerplate code. And even AMD can already be applied on browser environment CommonJS is preferred specification already used by Node.js and other frameworks.</p>
  				<p>That being said I would prefer CommonJS since it provides a clean way to import dependencies in JavaScript.</p>
  			</td>
  		</tr>
  		<tr>
  			<td><p>Explain why the following doesn't work as an IIFE: function foo(){ }();.</p></td>
  			<td><p></p></td>
  		</tr>
  		<tr>
  			<td><p>What needs to be changed to properly make it an IIFE?</p></td>
  			<td><p></p></td>
  		</tr>
  		<tr>
  			<td><p>What's the difference between a variable that is: null, undefined or undeclared?</p></td>
  			<td><p></p></td>
  		</tr>
  		<tr>
  			<td><p>How would you go about checking for any of these states?</p></td>
  			<td><p></p></td>
  		</tr>
  		<tr>
  			<td><p>What is a closure, and how/why would you use one?</p></td>
  			<td>
  				<p>Closures are functions that allow it's containing function to access data that is outside of its local scope.</p>
  				<p>The way it works is that when closure function is executed an activation object is created. That object contains local variable which becomes the first object in the execution context's scope chain, and global object coming second.</p>
  				<p>The downside of using it is more memory usage due to non standard function behaviour where as soon as the execution context is destroyed the activation object isn't because the reference still exists in the closure's property. Another issue would also be speed concerns due to constant access to out-of-scope identifiers.</p>
  				<p>Best way to use it is with caution, especially in large web applications.</p>

  			<td><p>Why is it, in general, a good idea to leave the global scope of a website as-is and never touch it?</p></td>
