  	<h3>Hello!</h3>
  	<p>My name is Sinisa Mikulic, and I know answers to these questions!</p>

  	<h4>General Questions:</h4>
  	<table>
  		<tr>
  			<td><p>What did you learn yesterday/this week?</p></td>
  			<td><p>ES6 classes. Having a single convenient declarative form makes class patterns easier to use. They also support constructors prototype-based inheritance, super calls, instance methods and static methods.</p></td>
  		</tr>
		<tr>
		  	<td><p>What excites or interests you about coding?</p></td>
		  	<td><p>Solving problems. More precisely, developing a solution for a problem that would otherwise take either much longer to do manually and making that solution smart so it could be applied to many similar problems.</p></td>
	  	</tr>
	  	<tr>
		  	<td><p>What UI, Security, Performance, SEO, Maintainability or Technology considerations do you make while building a web application or site?</p></td>
		  	<td>
		  		<p>It all depends on the project requirements. If the project is 'fire and forget' then I would focus on standards and longevity of that project, because if it's clear that there would be no maintainance on it, it would need to be future-proof (cross browser and device UI solutions).</p>
		  		<p>On the other hand, high-scale and agile projects would need much more effort into making the code modular, resuable, well documented and in general more maintainable, as well as test coverage and performance optimisations.</p>
		  		<p>In both cases, user/client experience should always be top most priority.</p>
		  	</td>
	  	</tr>
	  	<tr>
		  	<td><p>Talk about your preferred development environment.</p></td>
		  	<td>
		  		<p>Gulp task runner won my heart by it's convention over configuration. It goes hand in hand with npm packages and super easy to setup. Terminal is a must, even in case where there is a time-saving GUI solution, there is still so many problems that can be resolved just by using command line.</p>
		  		<p>Editors can be as simple as Sublime Text or powerfull IDE's like WebStorm and of course Jira or other project management tools which keep your day to day progress in order.</p>
		  	</td>
	  	</tr>
	  	<tr>
		  	<td><p>Which version control systems are you familiar with?</p></td>
		  	<td>
		  		<p>Git, SVN. Worked with both, but Git and it's workflows (e.g. Gitflow) for agile development keep your mind off of versioning and let's you focus on development. Also Github!</p>
		  	</td>
	  	</tr>
	  	<tr>
		  	<td><p>Can you describe your workflow when you create a web page?</p></td>
		  	<td>
		  		
		  	</td>
	  	</tr>
	  	<tr>
		  	<td><p>If you have 5 different stylesheets, how would you best integrate them into the site?</p></td>
		  	<td>
		  		<p>From a performance perspective, a monolithic stylesheet is best because the request number is a bigger performance concern than the size of one. This is why I would concatenate them into one bigger stylesheet file and then minimize it using build tools so I can keep my development files separate and happy in their structure.</p>
		  	</td>
	  	</tr>
	  	<tr>
		  	<td><p>Can you describe the difference between progressive enhancement and graceful degradation?</p></td>
		  	<td>
		  		<p>Sure! progressive enhancement is mostly encouraged by mobile first approach for developing responsive websites and would like you to display all the important informational sections on the smallest desired screen and then proportionally scale it up so it fits bigger screens and changes the shape to fit them.</p>
		  		<p>Graceful degradation keeps your focus on desktop screens and encourages you to remove information/features which wouldn't make sense to keep on smaller screens.</p>
		  		<p>For example. Graceful degradation would like you to remove huge slider which uses some HD images and heavy weight scripts to run on mobile phones which wouldn't be able to run those scripts or would have no marketing impact when presenting those images - so it would be replaced by simple text. Using progressive enhancement method you could either start building slider with a much more standardized scripts or go with the decision that the slider won't even be necessary on desktop screen but the text should just appear larger.</p>

		  	<td><p>If you could master one technology this year, what would it be?</p></td>
		  	<td>
		  		<p>Node.js.</p>
		  	</td>

	  	<tr>
		  	<td><p>Explain the importance of standards and standards bodies.</p></td>

		  	</td>
	  	</tr>
	  	<tr>
		  	<td><p>What is Flash of Unstyled Content? How do you avoid FOUC?</p></td>
		  	<td>
		  		<p>When browsers encounter a stylesheet loading directive, they can either stall parsing and wait for the stylesheet to load, keep going, or stall on demand. Safari currently uses the "keep going" approach. 
		  		This triggers an FOUC when a script tries to access a property that the browser doesn't know the value of because the CSS hasn't loaded yet.
		  		The effect of it havign a website look like it's unstyled for a few seconds.</p>
		  		<p>Simple method for minimizing FOUC is by hiding all or part of the web page until all styles and JavaScript are finished by applying a class name "js" as the selector that hides all content within a container that has an id="fouc".</p>
